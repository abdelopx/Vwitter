        <p>This is a Twitter clone web application made using the awesome framework Quasar</p>
        <p>You can also try to build the same thing as what I did by getting more information about the Quasar Framework which can be found on their Official website.</p>
        <p>This is not an official application of Twitter ! :)</p>
